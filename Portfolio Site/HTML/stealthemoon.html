            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Yo! I'm Pongaskon also known as Tom or Tomsa, a dedicated and versatile developer with a deep-rooted passion for coding since the age of 12. Over the years, I have built expertise across multiple domains, including video game development, web development, backend data processing, Python applications, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and many other programming languages.
                <br><br>
                Beyond technical proficiency, I bring a strong work ethic, honesty, and a methodical approach to problem-solving. I do not rush through tasks or cut corners; I believe in taking the time necessary to ensure every project is done properly and to the highest standard. My calm and collected nature allows me to approach challenges with patience and precision, ensuring that solutions are both effective and sustainable.

        <div class="myValues relative">
            <h2>My Values</h2>
            <p>I uphold the principle that there is no excuse for doing anything less than the best. Quality and precision take precedence over speed, and I am committed to delivering work that is thorough, well-structured, and long-lasting.
                <br><br>
                Cleanliness is another core value in both my work and environment—I believe that a well-organized space fosters clarity, and I apply the same philosophy to my code. Every line I write is structured, efficient, and maintainable, ensuring not just functionality but long-term readability and optimization.
                <br><br>
                I also value direct and transparent communication. I do not hide behind ambiguity—if something doesn’t work or if there is a better approach, I will state it openly and honestly. Clarity and efficiency are essential in driving projects forward with purpose and precision.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="myWorkEthic relative">
            <h2>Work Ethic & Team Dynamic</h2>
            <p>I am highly dedicated to my work, sometimes starting before official work hours if I have free time after my workout or morning routine. I like to stay ahead and prepare for any situation—whether it’s resolving a workplace conflict, answering questions, or tackling unexpected challenges. No matter the obstacle, I get my tasks done.
                <br><br>
                As a coworker, I balance seriousness with humor. While I take my work seriously, I also believe that a good laugh helps keep stress in check. Whether it’s sending memes in group chats or sneaking inside jokes into the code, I make sure that the work environment remains engaging and enjoyable while staying productive.
                <br><br>
                My stubbornness is another key aspect of my approach—once I commit to a task, I see it through, no matter how difficult or time-consuming it may be. I don’t give up until the job is done right.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="leadershipSkills relative">
            <h2>Leadership & Team Well-Being</h2>
            <p>I take the well-being of my team seriously—both physically and mentally. If a coworker or even my boss seems unwell, I don’t just tell them to rest; I actively encourage them to take care of themselves. I might recommend medicine for their symptoms, suggest foods or fruits to boost their immune system, or offer practical advice to help them recover faster.
                <br>
                <br>
                I believe that people perform their best when they are at their best, so I make it a point to look out for my teammates. I may swear at my coworkers from time to time, but never behind their backs—everything I say comes from a place of honesty and care. At the end of the day, my goal is to foster an environment where people feel supported, respected, and capable of performing at their highest potential.
                <br>
                <br>
                My leadership skills were further refined during my years as a student council member from ages 12 to 17. Working closely with students, teachers, and staff, I developed strong organizational, communication, and problem-solving skills—qualities that continue to shape my approach to teamwork and project execution today.</p>
