### Summery

Self-taught software developer with experience in various topics. Software development or customer service? Both are done with burning passion and honesty. Renewed determination as software developer after a long break and career change - rebuilding myself both in beginner and advance topics. Becoming almost an artisan in both digital world and behind the bar.

During the break, I gained valuable experience in hospitality roles that strengthened my customer service and problem-solving abilities under pressure. I also developed expertise in 3D modeling/printing, graphic design, marketing, video production, and network administration through dedicated hobby projects. This multidisciplinary background enables me to approach development with a comprehensive understanding of the entire product pipeline—from design and technical implementation to marketing and user experience. I bring renewed enthusiasm, diverse skills, and the ability to collaborate effectively across teams while building user-centered applications.

Coming back to software development with a strong foundation in C, C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, and web technologies (HTML, CSS). Recently resumed development work after a break, rebuilding and expanding my technical knowledge through hands-on projects. Experienced across diverse domains, including game development, machine learning, and network protocols (TCP, HTTP), with ongoing personal projects such as voxel engine creation and website development. Familiar with frameworks and tools like React Native, Redis, and database design. Passionate about continuous learning, refining best practices, and applying low-level programming and system design skills to real-world development challenges.
