        <h3>Inventorio</h3>
        <p>A sort little introduction to my project. This is my first big project ever. With an intention of being published and being completed for world to use. Invenotry is fully customizable inventory management software where you can yourself change the location of each and every button to your desire. Equipped with advanced functions to ease out management time. Barcode scanner and full fledge backend for all to use. My primary objective is to solve the issue I used to experience as a bartender.</p>

        <h3>Musico</h3>
        <p> A Digital Audio Workstation Game is meant to connect music production and gaming. Primarily a software where you can learn and make music in gamified format. Mainly targeted for beginners and students with an intention of letting new comers in music industry learn and master even the most basic of basics. Stuff like rhythm, notes, or any instrument without anything getting boring. A leveling system seen in most games can be made into indications of learned experience. With each produced songs you get leveling system rewards, for example shout outs, hidden quest, or account boosts. </p>

        <h3>Workout Gamification</h3>
        <p> This "game" is meant to  turn self improvement into a game. Hugely inspired by animes/manwha like, solo leveling, the max-level player's 100th regressions, and beginning after the end. With a philosophy of continuous self improvement. Making going to gym less punishing for "nerds" like me since you would still be playing games. Teaching your body to be in a discomfort for future body shapes. There might be some improvement ideas for the future. Maybe calorie tracking and habit tracker. Less is more. No intention for ads. One time purchase licensing. </p>
