                I’m Pongaskon, a passionate and versatile developer with a deep-rooted love for coding since the age of 12. Over the years, I’ve honed my skills in various domains, including video game development, web development, backend data processing, Python applications, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and many other programming languages.
                <br>
                <br>
                Beyond technical expertise, I bring a strong work ethic, honesty, and an unshakable determination to see things through until they work. No matter how complex the challenge, I push forward with persistence and problem-solving until I find a solution. My experience working with diverse clients has also sharpened my communication and collaboration skills. Additionally, working outside of tech—such as in the service industry—has given me invaluable people skills, making me an effective team player in any professional environment.
